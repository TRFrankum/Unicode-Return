# Unicode-Return

What is this? This is a first project, made before my first day of actual instruction in my introduction to programming class, made only with the resources availible to me on Google and a rough knowledge of how programming works.

What does it DO? Asks for a single character, returns it's Unicode name and hex value. 

I specifically safeguarded against users putting in more than one character. 

I did NOT however figure out (yet) how to get the damn thing to ask you more than once, just in case you wanted to do that.

This program runs ONCE and ONCE only. You don't need it more than that. Run it again if you do. #featurenotabug
